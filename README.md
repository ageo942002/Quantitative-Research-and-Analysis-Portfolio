# Quantitative Research and Econometric Portfolio

This repository contains a curated set of quantitative research projects
focusing on econometric modelling, structural and reduced-form time series
analysis, forecasting, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language
processing. The work emphasises formal model specification, identification,
estimation, and rigorous evaluation of empirical results in economic and
financial contexts.

Projects are implemented in Python, R, and MATLAB, and are structured to support
reproducible research workflows. Where applicable, each project is accompanied
by a written technical report detailing the theoretical framework, estimation
strategy, empirical findings, and limitations.

## Project Categories

### Econometric Analysis and Data Analysis
Empirical econometric studies applying regression-based and likelihood-based
methods to cross-sectional and time series data, with an emphasis on
interpretability and inference.

Methodological components include:
- Linear and nonlinear regression models
- Maximum likelihood estimation
- Hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction
- Robust standard errors and diagnostic testing
- Interpretation of coefficients and marginal effects
- Discussion of identification and potential sources of bias

### Gali (1999) SVAR Replication and Forecasting
A structural vector autoregression (SVAR) replication study based on the
long-run identification strategy proposed in Gali (1999), analysing the dynamic
effects of technology shocks on key macroeconomic variables.

Key elements include:
- Structural identification using long-run restrictions
- Estimation of reduced-form and structural VARs
- Impulse response and forecast error variance decomposition analysis
- Examination of the forecasting implications of SVAR models
- Comparison with reduced-form VAR benchmarks

The accompanying report provides a detailed discussion of identifying
assumptions, estimation procedures, and empirical results.

### Machine Learning for Forecasting
Applications of machine learning techniques to forecasting problems in economic
and financial time series, focusing on predictive performance and model
selection.

Core components include:
- Regularised regression methods (e.g. LASSO, Elastic Net)
- Feature selection and model complexity control
- Cross-validation and out-of-sample forecast evaluation
- Benchmarking against classical econometric models

Results are interpreted in light of economic plausibility and model stability.

### Deep Learning Projects
Deep learning models applied to high-dimensional and time-dependent data,
examining their performance relative to econometric and traditional machine
learning benchmarks.

Topics include:
- Neural network architectures for time series modelling
- Training, tuning, and regularisation strategies
- Overfitting control and generalisation performance
- Comparative evaluation against simpler predictive models

The analysis emphasises both predictive accuracy and methodological limitations.

### NLP Models for Financial Reports
Natural language processing models applied to financial reports and economic
text, treating text as a source of quantitative information for analysis and
prediction.

Methods include:
- Text preprocessing and representation
- Supervised and unsupervised learning approaches
- Construction and interpretation of text-based indicators
- Assessment of the empirical relevance of textual signals in financial
  contexts

## Languages and Tools

- **Python**: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, deep learning libraries  
- **R**: tidyverse, lmtest, sandwich, forecast, VAR/SVAR packages  
- **MATLAB**: structural and reduced-form time series modelling

## Notes

Several projects were initially developed in an academic setting and were
subsequently refined to emphasise independent analysis, methodological clarity,
and reproducibility. Each project includes code, empirical results, and written
documentation describing the research question, data, modelling approach,
evaluation strategy, and limitations.
